I didn't know you could flex ul and ol elements to create custom list styles and spacing.  Would like to have used ::marker instead but that I guess will come later.

This site would have been ideal to use with eleventy but as it's just the warmup for hte site I thought I'd keep it as vanilla html/css as possible.  going forward I'll be using eleventy or bridgetown to build out the site.  Probably eleventy so I can focus on Javascript and see if front-end is readlly for me and then possibly node for backend projects?
